I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at University College London (UCL). 

My research focuses on Development and Labour Economics.

I explore how social norms shape the behaviour of individuals and firms, with a particular focus on the following questions:â€¨ 
1.  How culture, language, and norms influence policy effectiveness and economic outcomes
2.  Firm behaviour and labour market consequences when firms adopt objectives beyond profit maximisation
