I am a fourth-year PhD student in Economics at University College London (UCL). 

I study development and labour economics, with a primary focus on Asia. 

My research interests include:
1. Policy design and public goods provision in developing country contexts;
2. How social/cultural norms shape the behaviour of individuals and firms;
3. Occupational sorting shaped by wages and non-wage amenities.
