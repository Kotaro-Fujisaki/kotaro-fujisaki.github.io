  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

  Education policies commonly fall into two categories: cost/demand-side and supply-side interventions. This paper examines which approach more effectively serves underrepresented groups, taking local culture into account. Using a regression discontinuity design, it shows that Indonesia’s Free Primary Education (FPE) program, which abolished primary school tuition fees in 1977–1978, improved previously low female educational attainment. These educational gains also reduced child marriage and raised future earnings. Unlike the concurrent school construction program, FPE was equally effective across communities, irrespective of whether bride price is practiced. Absent institutions raising demand for girls' schooling, tuition removal can be more effective in promoting female education than supply-side interventions, thereby reducing gender gaps across cultural contexts.

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

  Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the integration of social, environmental, and ethical values into business practices. This paper studies its effects on firms’ profits, production, and environmental outcomes in Indonesia. To address endogeneity in CSR adoption, I exploit the country’s legal requirement that limited-liability firms in natural-resource–related industries implement CSR activities. A triple-difference design shows that the mandate improved environmental performance by reducing the use of polluting fuels. Effects are larger for firms with stronger community-based relational incentives, particularly those relying on locally sourced private capital. The fuel shift involved a reallocation of expenditures but did not affect profits, output, total revenue, or total expenses. Village–firm matched data corroborate a decline in reported pollution incidents around obligated firms. Even without strong enforcement, legal CSR requirements can complement traditional environmental regulation when firms are embedded in local networks that provide additional CSR incentives.
